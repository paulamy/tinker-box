this is just a place to store the side projects I've been working on with no specific goal other than practicing stuff that interests me

I also have some projects I've worked on in collaboration with others; right now: 
1. Vending Machine (partner project, ~50/50 split)
2. Money Transfer App (partner project, ~50/50 split)
3. Math Practice App (starter HTML and CSS provided; JS is original)

07/31/21 UPDATE: 
I'm expanding the Math Practice App into a Vue.js project. 

Version 1: The initial goal is to replicate the original app using Vue.js with some expanded feature control (e.g. allowing user control over: changing the size of the problem set, the size of numbers involved, including negative numbers, etc.).

Planned Features:
1. allow user to instead generate and print a PDF of the problem set
2. allow user to register and login to save their cumulative stats (problems worked, correct answers, etc.)
3. allow authenticated user to save problem sets for later use or printing
4. include other types of problem sets beyond arithmetic operations
5. include other types of numbers beyond integers
6. consume external APIs (e.g. Desmos) to expand features
